	The Election Commission Tuesday gave a clean chit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his April 1st speech at Wardha. While referring to Rahul Gandhi’s decision to also contest from Kerala’s Wayanad constituency, PM Modi had said the Congress was taking "refuge in areas where the majority is in minority".

	The latest development came hours after The Indian Express reported that the full Commission had not held a single deliberation since April 5 on the alleged violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) by PM Modi. Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court had sought the poll watchdog’s response on a plea by a Congress MP alleging MCC violations by Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah over their alleged hate speeches and using armed forces for "political propaganda".
